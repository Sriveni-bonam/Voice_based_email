# ðŸ“§ Voice-Based Email System for Visually Impaired

---

## **ABSTRACT**

One of the most used forms of communication among people is **Email**. A lot of confidential and urgent information is exchanged over emails in todayâ€™s time. There are about **253 million visually impaired people** worldwide. These visually impaired individuals face challenges in accessing conventional email systems due to their visual limitations.

As technology evolves rapidly, visually challenged people may feel increasingly disconnected. To bridge this gap, we propose a **Voice-Based Email System using AI** that makes email communication **easily accessible through voice commands**. This system is designed to provide an inclusive experience, allowing visually impaired users to send, receive, and manage emails using **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech** functionalities â€” with minimal screen interaction. **Accessibility** remains the core focus while developing this solution.
